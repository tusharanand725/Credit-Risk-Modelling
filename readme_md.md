# Credit Risk Modeling Project

A comprehensive machine learning project for credit risk assessment and loan approval decisions using advanced statistical techniques and logistic regression.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project implements a complete credit risk modeling pipeline that facilitates loan approval decisions and improves credit risk management. The model achieves an **AUCPR of 0.97** through sophisticated feature engineering and statistical analysis techniques.

## 🔧 Key Features

- **Advanced Data Preprocessing**: Comprehensive data cleaning, outlier detection, and missing value imputation
- **Feature Engineering**: PCA analysis, correlation analysis, and K-means clustering for optimal feature selection
- **WOE/IV Analysis**: Weight of Evidence and Information Value techniques for data binning and feature transformation
- **Logistic Regression Model**: Robust classification model with cross-validation and performance evaluation
- **Credit Scorecard**: Automated scorecard generation for practical credit scoring
- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: ROC curves, Precision-Recall curves, calibration plots, and detailed performance metrics

## 📊 Model Performance

- **AUCPR**: 0.97 (Area Under Precision-Recall Curve)
- **ROC AUC**: 0.95+ (Area Under ROC Curve)
- **Cross-Validation**: 5-fold stratified validation
- **Feature Selection**: Information Value-based selection with statistical significance testing
